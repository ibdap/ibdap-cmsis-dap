# IBDAP-CMSIS-DAP
IBDAP CMSIS-DAP firmware source code. Build with gcc and makefile. Latest 2020 version.

[https://www.ibdap.net](https://www.ibdap.net)

IBDAP is a fully CMSIS-DAP compatible debug adapter. It provides vendor independent debug interface between your PC over USB and target ARM device over JTAG/SWD pins. You can do firmware debuggings like stepping, breakpoints, watch points and firmware download etc. It's fully supported by Keil, OpenOCD, GNU GDB, IAR and other commonly used debugging tools.

# Why IBDAP?

Debug adapters are expensive, some could cost thousands of dollars, some may not be compatible among different vendors. Luckily, ARM standardized the debugging interface which is called CMSIS-DAP and released the firmware implementation on some processors, however, you still need a Keil MDK Professional edition software in order to build the firmware, even the open source one provided by mbed and the price for Keil Professional is intimidating. All these barriers has become the first issue that every inventor is facing, and we need a solution!
IBDAP's objective is to become an affordable open source & open hardware CMSIS-DAP JTAG/SWD debug probe implementation using gcc & makefile. Anyone can modify and embed a debug probe on its own device easily with everything under its control.

Besides being functioning as a JTAG/SWD debug probe, IBDAP could also be used as a general development board. It has an ARM Cortex M0 processor  running at 48Mhz and has peripherals like UART, I2C, SPI, USB. It can be used in many applications like USB audio devices, USB mouse/keyboards, USB mass storage devices, USB-TTL adapter device and many many more. Moreover, the 10-bit high precision ADC peripheral also makes IBDAP an ideal device for any sensor projects.

## install deps

sudo apt-get install build-essential

sudo apt-get install autotools-dev autoconf automake libtool

sudo apt-get install texinfo libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libfox-1.6-dev


## Download FTDI driver

```

tar xf libftdi1-1.2.tar.bz2
```

## HIDAPI 

```
git clone git://github.com/signal11/hidapi.git

```

## Build and Install OpenOCD

```
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/openocd/code
cd code
./bootstrap
cd ../
mkdir ./openocd-build
cd openocd-build
../code/configure --with-ftd2xx-linux-tardir=../libftdi1-1.2 --prefix=/opt/openocd --enable-jlink --enable-ftdi --enable-stlink --enable-ti-icdi --enable-ulink --enable-usb-blaster-2 --enable-cmsis-dap --enable-bcm2835gpio

```
## Usage

### Prepare extra OpenOCD cfg commands

create file openocd.cfg with following contents:

```
$_TARGETNAME configure -event gdb-attach {
   echo "Halting target"
   halt
}
```

### Start OpenOCD server to Debug LPC11U35

```
sudo openocd -f interface/jlink.cfg -c "transport select swd" -f target/lpc11xx.cfg -f openocd.cfg 

```

### Flash and Debug

- First, flash debug firmware on board

```
telnet localhost 4444
reset halt
flash probe 0
flash write_image erase /home/yliu/projects/ib51822/IBDAP-FW/Firmware/IBDAP/Debug/IBDAP.bin 0x0
reset
exit
```

- Second, debug using the commands:

```
target remote localhost:3333
break IBDAP.c:103
monitor reset halt
monitor reset init
continue
```

### Breakpoint limits

```
set remote hardware-breakpoint-limit 4
set remote hardware-watchpoint-limit 2
```

### gdbtui GUI debugging
